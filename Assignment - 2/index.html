        	<h2>Coding challenge - 2</h2>

        <p>John and Mike both play basketball in different teams. In the latest 3 games, John's team scored 89, 120 and 103 points, while Mike's team scored 116, 94 and 123 points.<br><br>

        1. Calculate the average score for each team<br>
        2. Decide which teams wins in average (highest average score), and print the winner to the console. Also include the average score in the output.<br>
        3. Then change the scores to show different winners. Don't forget to take into account there might be a draw (the same average score)<br><br>

        4. <b>EXTRA:</b> Mary also plays basketball, and her team scored 97, 134 and 105 points. Like before, log the average winner to the console. <br>
            &nbsp; HINT: you will need the && operator to take the decision.<br>
        5. Like before, change the scores to generate different winners, keeping in mind there might be draws.<br>
