        	<h2>Coding challenge - 5</h2>

        <p>Remember the tip calculator challenge? Let's create a more advanced version using everything we learned!<br><br>

            This time, John and his family went to 5 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48, $268, $180 and $42.<br>
            John likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.<br><br>

            Implement a tip calculator using objects and loops:<br>
            1. Create an object with an array for the bill values<br>
            2. Add a method to calculate the tip<br>
            3. This method should include a loop to iterate over all the paid bills and do the tip calculations<br>
            4. As an output, create<br>
            &nbsp; 1) a new array containing all tips, and <br>
            &nbsp; 2) an array containing final paid amounts (bill + tip). <br>
            &nbsp; HINT: Start with two empty arrays [] as properties and then fill them up in the loop.<br><br>


            <b>EXTRA AFTER FINISHING:</b> <br>
            Mark's family also went on a holiday, going to 4 different restaurants. The bills were $77, $375, $110, and $45.<br>
            Mark likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $100, 10% when the bill is between $100 and $300, and 25% if the bill is more than $300 (different than John).<br><br>

            5. Implement the same functionality as before, this time using Mark's tipping rules<br>
            6. Create a function (not a method) to calculate the average of a given array of tips. <br>
            HINT: Loop over the array, and in each iteration store the current sum in a variable (starting from 0). After you have the sum of the array, divide it by the number of elements in it (that's how you calculate the average)<br>
            7. Calculate the average tip for each family<br>
            8. Log to the console which family paid the highest tips on average<br>
