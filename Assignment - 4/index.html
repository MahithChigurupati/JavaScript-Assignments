        	<h2>Coding challenge - 4</h2>

        <p>Let's remember the first coding challenge where Mark and John compared their BMIs. Let's now implement the same functionality with objects and methods.<br><br>
        1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and height<br>
        2. Then, add a method to each object to calculate the BMI. Save the BMI to the object and also return it from the method.<br>
        3. In the end, log to the console who has the highest BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI. Don't forget they might have the same BMI.<br><br>

        Remember: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).
