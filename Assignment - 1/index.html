			Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).<br><br>

			1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables<br>
			2. Calculate both their BMIs<br>
			3. Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.<br>
			4. Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3. (Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true"). </p>
